# Onhand Test Fixtures

This document defines the preferred fixture set for manual and Computer Use smoke tests.

For the default named smoke flows, see `docs/SMOKE_TESTS.md`.

Use:

- `npm run test:fixtures` for the full bundle
- `npm run test:fixtures -- trump` to filter by a term
- `npm run test:fixtures -- --json` for machine-readable output

These fixtures are chosen from URLs that have already shown up repeatedly in prior Onhand sessions, with an emphasis on:

- stable availability
- coverage of distinct product risks
- realistic user questions
- good visual stress cases for notes, highlights, side panel behavior, and Learning Mode

## Selection Rules

Prefer fixtures that are:

- already used in prior sessions
- likely to remain reachable without expiring auth
- visually rich enough to expose annotation/layout bugs
- semantically rich enough to test deep explanation instead of only lookup

Avoid using:

- signed, expiring URLs when a stable alternative exists
- personal mail/chat/docs unless explicitly needed
- pages that are too thin to test grounding properly

## Primary Fixture Set

### 1. Long Article With Infobox and Dense Body

**URL**
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump`

**Why this is in the set**
- very frequently used in prior sessions
- large article with many sections and an infobox
- good for verifying:
  - note placement around the right-side infobox
  - multi-highlight grounding
  - causal / change-over-time questions
  - multi-claim evidence selection
  - inline citations in the reply

**Best test prompts**
- `how did he win the 2024 election after losing in 2020?`
- `what changed between 2020 and 2024?`
- `use the page to support each major claim`

**Main product risks covered**
- note overlap with infobox
- weak grounding vs. unsupported explanation
- multi-highlight + multi-note behavior
- current-turn reply rendering

### 2. Article With Infobox, Narrow Content Column, and Visual Placement Pressure

**URL**
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan`

**Why this is in the set**
- repeatedly used to expose note width / placement problems
- body text is narrow enough that oversized notes look bad quickly
- good for testing whether notes adapt to available width instead of colliding with the infobox

**Best test prompts**
- `why did he become such a big star?`
- `what on this page best explains his rise?`

**Main product risks covered**
- note width and wrapping
- highlight selection quality
- answer-to-evidence proportionality
- over-grounding vs. selective grounding

### 5. Jupyter-Like Technical Page With Nested Lists / Rich DOM

**URL**
- `https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/courses/Spring2026/lectures/07cnn/CNNs.html`

**Why this is in the set**
- has already exposed annotation behavior on nested list items and notebook-like content
- useful for testing highlight anchoring on less conventional DOM structures

**Best test prompts**
- `explain this CNN filter step`

**Why this is in the set**
- starts from a direct content-type PDF URL instead of an already-open Onhand viewer
- verifies `browser_open_pdf_in_onhand_viewer` can infer the PDF source and open the extension-owned viewer
- covers the native/direct PDF product path without depending on a `.pdf` suffix or Chrome's opaque PDF viewer internals for annotation

**Best test prompts**
- `open this PDF in Onhand's viewer and explain recurrent neural networks`
- `use the Onhand PDF viewer for this PDF, then highlight recurrent neural networks and save the page state`

**Main product risks covered**
- direct/native PDF handoff into the Onhand viewer
- preserving the original PDF URL inside `pdf-viewer.html?url=...`
- continuing with normal visible-text, highlight, note, and capture tools after the handoff

### 6d. Controlled Scholar-like PDF Fixture

**URL**
- `http://127.0.0.1:8765/scholar-pdf.html?file=/fixtures/scholar-reader.pdf` after running `npm run serve:fixture`

**Why this is in the set**
- deterministic Google Scholar-style PDF fixture for local validation
- includes actual Reader-like `.gsr-page[data-pn]`, `.gsr-text-ctn`, and `.gsr-text[data-idx]` nodes, plus selectable PDF text and native-looking Scholar highlight/comment UI
- verifies Onhand does not treat Scholar's native comments, color controls, or toolbars as PDF source text

**Best test prompts**
- `read the visible PDF text and confirm native Scholar comments are not source text`
- `highlight recurrent neural networks and add an Onhand note without using the Scholar comment popup`

**Main product risks covered**
- Google Scholar-style PDF surface detection
- coexistence with another PDF annotation layer
- excluding native PDF viewer UI from source extraction
- PDF capture/restore when viewer URL and document URL differ

### 7. Repository Landing Page With README and GitHub Chrome

**URL**
- `https://github.com/Phineas1500/Onhand`

**Why this is in the set**
- tests grounding on repository hosting UI instead of article prose or notebook-like notes
- good for verifying README extraction, code-adjacent summaries, and citation placement around GitHub’s sticky repo chrome

**Best test prompts**
- `what is this repo for and what are the main components?`
- `explain the structure of this repo from the README and page content`

**Main product risks covered**
- README extraction quality
- grounding on code/docs hosting UIs
- note and highlight placement around sticky repository chrome

### 8. Structured Public Job Page With Sticky CTA

**URL**
- `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5183006008`

**Why this is in the set**
- tests structured commercial/public pages outside docs and encyclopedic layouts
- useful for sticky CTA overlap, long-form summaries, and section-based grounding

**Best test prompts**
- `what does this role emphasize most?`
- `what on this page would matter most to an applicant?`

**Main product risks covered**
- annotation placement near sticky apply controls
- grounding on sectioned marketing/careers pages
- answer proportionality on non-encyclopedic pages

### 9. Dynamic Social Thread

**URL**

- `summarize the dominant viewpoints on this page`

**Main product risks covered**
- highlighting/comment grounding in dynamic thread UIs
- reply citations on conversational content
- annotation placement near interactive social controls

## Secondary Fixtures

These are useful, but not part of the minimum smoke set.

### Personal Computer History
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer`
- good for multi-highlight factual comparison
- good for note placement in article prose without heavy political content

### Steve Wozniak
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak`
- useful for “how much did X contribute?” style questions
- good for checking whether the agent uses deeper sections, not only the intro

### Graph Representation Notes
- `https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/courses/Spring2026/lectures/13GNNs/Graph_Representations_part1.html`
- useful for cross-tab technical synthesis with other Purdue notes

### Technical / Math / CS Grounding Fixtures

Use these when testing whether Onhand can answer from dense technical pages, choose the right evidence, and avoid getting stuck in browser-tool loops.

#### PyTorch Conv2d Docs
- fixture id: `pytorch_conv2d`
- URL: `https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.modules.conv.Conv2d.html`
- prompt: `I'm confused by groups, dilation, and the output shape formula. Use this page to explain what each changes and what I should check when debugging shape mismatches.`
- reply checks: `groups`, `dilation`
- risks: Sphinx math anchoring, formula highlighting, parameter-specific grounding

#### The Annotated Transformer
- fixture id: `annotated_transformer`
- URL: `https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/`
- prompt: `Explain the scaled dot-product attention section and why the 1/sqrt(d_k) scaling is needed; point me to the key code and equation.`
- reply checks: `softmax`, `gradients`, `sqrt`
- risks: long notebook pages, tool-loop avoidance, equation/code evidence selection

#### cp-algorithms Sparse Dijkstra
- fixture id: `cp_algorithms_dijkstra_sparse`
- URL: `https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/dijkstra_sparse.html`
- prompt: `Guide me through why sparse-graph Dijkstra needs a priority queue or set and what complexity tradeoff the page is making.`
- reply checks: `priority_queue`, `stale`
- risks: missing stale-entry logic, shallow complexity summaries

#### Distill Augmented RNNs
- fixture id: `distill_attention_rnns`
- URL: `https://distill.pub/2016/augmented-rnns/`
- prompt: `Explain the attention section. What bottleneck is attention solving, and what should I look at first?`
- reply checks: `attention`, `query`
- risks: visually rich conceptual pages, weak passage selection

#### Fast Fourier Transform Wikipedia
- fixture id: `wikipedia_fft`
- URL: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform`
- prompt: `Explain the Cooley-Tukey idea and why the recurrence gives O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).`
- reply checks: `Cooley`, `O(n log n)`, `DFT`
- risks: using only the lead, weak recurrence/complexity explanation

#### Attention Is All You Need arXiv Abstract
- fixture id: `arxiv_attention_transformer`
- URL: `https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762`
- prompt: `Use this abstract to explain what the Transformer changed and what the abstract does not explain in detail.`
- reply checks: `Transformer`, `recurrent`
- risks: cross-tab drift, unsupported claims beyond the abstract

## Fixture Notes

- Prefer the Piazza PDF over the signed Gradescope PDF for repeatable testing.
- Treat the GitHub repo and Anthropic job page as stable public fixtures.
- Treat the Reddit thread as useful but less stable than the other public fixtures.
- Treat the technical/math/CS fixtures as content-quality checks, not only layout checks.
- Prefer the Purdue lecture pages over arbitrary web pages for STEM tutoring tests because they are already part of your real use case.
- Prefer `Donald_Trump` over thinner biography pages when you need to test deep causal explanation, because it contains more explicit evidence across sections.
- Prefer `Shah_Rukh_Khan` when testing note sizing and infobox collisions, because it has already exposed those issues in practice.

## Suggested Standard Prompts

Use these repeatedly so regressions are easier to spot:

- `why did he become such a big star?`
- `how did he win the 2024 election after losing in 2020?`
- `use the notes I have open to help me understand how to solve this problem`
- `teach this in learning mode`
- `what prerequisite concept should I read first?`
- `compare what these two tabs are saying`
- `explain the key equation and code path on this technical page`
- `what are the most important caveats or debugging checks here?`

## Fixture Helper

The fixture helper script prints this bundle directly:

- `npm run test:fixtures`
- `npm run test:fixtures -- learning`
- `node ./scripts/show-test-fixtures.mjs --json`
